tk                # For GUI (Tkinter comes with Python, but some systems may need it)
speechrecognition # Voice input
pyttsx3           # Text-to-speech
transformers      # Hugging Face Transformers models
torch             # Required backend for Transformers models

ðŸ’¡ Notes:
Libraries like threading, queue, datetime, os, sys, re, random, logging are built into Python, so you donâ€™t need to list them.
tkinter is part of the standard library on most Python installations, but on some Linux systems, you might need to install it via your package manager (sudo apt install python3-tk).
